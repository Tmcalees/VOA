Volunteers of America Upstate New York Donor Management Application 

The application is used to track donors and schedule the routea used to pickup up donated goods. This version of the application is build to be compatible with a database schema used by an earlier version of the application (with some minor enhancements). It is the 3rd version of the application. Each previous version had similar functionality but was written with a different development toolkit (v1 - ASP and V2 ASP.NET).
